          <h2 style="color:red"><center><b>FAQs</b></center></h2>
          <h4 style="color:red"><center>Frequently Asked Questions I Get</center></h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Do you speak any other languages?</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>At the moment, I speak a little bit of Malagasy and French. Reason why I speak a little is because across the places I lived, I surrounded myself with English speakers (I wish I had learned more French growing up instead of this).</li>
              </ul>
            <li><b>What is your favorite place you've been to?</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>I love the places I've been to, but probably Vancouver since that is my hometown. Leaving my home was a struggle, but I find it's easier to adapt to a new environment and country when you're younger and more mentally flexible. I plan on obtaining dual citizenship eventually.</li>
              </ul>
            <li><b>What are some pros and cons of traveling constantly? What is it like?</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li><u>Pros:</u> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>You get to experience many cultures and become more educated about the real world. For example, experiencing different foods, languages, sports, clothing, etc. </li>
                    <li>I'm not nervous about moving homes or locations since I'm used to it my whole life.</li>
                    <li>A sense of independence; due to traveling constantly, patience and navigation skills are improved.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li><u>Cons:</u> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>You have to ditch your home and friends and make new friends constantly. It can set your mentality back and make you lag a bit in one's developmental years.</li>
                    <li>A sense of dependence; my father's job covered educational costs up until graduation from high school. The government would also assist you in finding you a house for wherever you're stationed/working, supplying you with health insurance, and even having a personal driver and maid in the house (when in third world countries).</li>
                  </ul>
